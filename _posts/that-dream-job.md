After a series of interviews, I received a full time offer from MS a few weeks ago. To my own surprise, the interviews actually turned out to be a fun exercise - especially since I was worried about various ways to screw it up. And now, I want to talk all about the "hardship" that lead up to the offer. This will be a highly opinionated post depicting what worked for *me*.

The Boilerplate
----
Any sensible post about preparing for a job interview will discuss about making a killer CV, applying through references, quantifying your specific contributions in your previous jobs/projects, not showing up too late or too soon for an interview, and so it goes. I figured, might as well get this over with, because frankly, they are not wrong - for most part. They may be boilerplate suggestions but they are not wrong, and I myself followed most of it as discussed in [Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/). Instead of quoting things from the book, I strongly advice that you go over it once and then again before each interview - been there, done that and helped me a ton! I can't stress this enough but just so you know, the last thing I did before most of my interviews, Microsoft one included, was to go over some bookmarks I added in that book. Quantifying your contributions is good thing and applying through references definitely puts you in a better position than otherwise. For reference, here is the [CV I used while applying to Microsoft](https://github.com/praveendath92/resume/blob/f72fa791d02f61ce4d9ed4b69f1644fb163bdcb2/short/cv.pdf).


Setting Goals
----
More often than not, it helps if you have in mind at least a vague idea about the jobs or companies you are aiming for. When I started my job search I was faily proficient in Web, Android, Java and Python development - I literally had enough convincing work to back up my expertise in any field I choose among these. Okay bragging aside, I do have a point, that I didn't go by searching for jobs in all of these areas. Because that would dilute my search efforts in any single domain. Instead, I made a pick or two based on where I can sell myself better and also what interests me more - I went with Android and Java BTW. Since I stopped trying to be jack of many trades, it helped me focus. I started soling any new coding challenge in Java (before, I was doing them in Python). While it's not strictly necessary, it might help if you also have a set of companies you are aiming for. I had the big 4 - Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft, on my list. Share your list with a few friends and ask them for an honest feedback because that will help you figure out if you are being too ambitious or just selling yourself short. The big tech companies usually stress on Computer Science fundamentals so, it doesn't matter which names are in. But if you are going after very specialized firms, this would help you identify what you should devote your time to - a particular tool or tech stack or design concept, you get the point.
