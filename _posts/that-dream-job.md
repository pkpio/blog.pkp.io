After a series of interviews, I received a full time offer from MS a few weeks ago. To my own surprise, the interviews actually turned out to be a fun exercise - especially since I was worried about various ways to screw it up. And now, I want to talk all about the "hardship" that lead up to the offer. This will be a highly opinionated post depicting what worked for *me*.

The Boilerplate
----
Any sensible post about preparing for a job interview will discuss about making a killer CV, applying through references, quantifying your specific contributions in your previous jobs/projects, not showing up too late or too soon for an interview, and so it goes. I figured, might as well get this over with, because frankly, they are not wrong - for most part. They may be boilerplate suggestions but they are not wrong, and I myself followed most of it as discussed in "Cracking a Coding Interview by Gayle L.". Instead of quoting things from the book, I strongly advice that you go over it once and then again before each interview - been there, done that and helped me a ton! I can't stress this enough but just so you know, the last thing I did before most of my interviews, Microsoft one included, was to go over some bookmarks I added in that book. Quantifying your contributions is good thing and applying through references definitely puts you in a better position than otherwise.
