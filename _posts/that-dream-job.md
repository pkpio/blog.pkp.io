After a series of interviews, I received a full time offer from MS a few weeks ago. To my own surprise, the interviews actually turned out to be a fun exercise - especially since I was worried about various ways to screw it up. And now, I want to talk all about the "hardship" that lead up to the offer. This will be a highly opinionated post depicting what worked for *me*.

The Boilerplate
----
This is some typical boilerplate that almost all coding interview guides talk about. I will spare you the details as most of it can be found in "Cracking a Coding Interview by Gayle L.". That was the single reference I followed while making my CV, and preparing for behavioural aspects during an interview. Long story short, read it all and re-read it, at least the important aspects, before each interview. Been there, done that and can't stress enough how helpful it has been.
