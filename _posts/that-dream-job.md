title : Getting that dream job

After a series of interviews, I received a full time offer from MS a few weeks ago. To my own surprise, the interviews actually turned out to be a fun exercise - especially since I was worried about various ways to screw it up. And now, I want to talk all about the "hardship" that lead up to the offer. This will be a highly opinionated post depicting what worked for *me*.

The Boilerplate
----
Any sensible post about job interviews should discuss about making a killer CV, applying through references, quantifying your contributions in a job or project, and so it goes. We might as well get this over with, because frankly, they are not wrong for most part. It may be boilerplate suggestions but are nevertheless important, and I myself followed most of it as discussed in [Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/) - from here on out referred as CTCI. Instead of paraphrasing ideas from the book, I strongly advice that you go over it once and then again before each interview - been there, done that and helped me a ton! I can't stress this enough but, just so you know, the last thing I did before most of my interviews, Microsoft one included, was to go over some bookmarks I added in that book. Quantifying your contributions is good thing and applying through references definitely puts you in a better position than otherwise. For reference, here is a [version of my CV that I used while applying to Microsoft](https://github.com/praveendath92/resume/blob/f72fa791d02f61ce4d9ed4b69f1644fb163bdcb2/short/cv.pdf).


Setting Goals
----
More often than not, it helps if you have in mind at least a vague idea about the jobs or companies you are aiming for. When I started my job search I was fairly proficient in Android, Java, Angular and Python development - I literally had enough convincing work to back up my expertise in any field I choose among these. Okay bragging aside, I do have a point, that I didn't go about searching for jobs in all of these areas. Because that would dilute my search efforts in any single domain. Instead, I made a pick or two based on where I can sell myself better and also what interests me more - I went with Android and Java BTW. Since I stopped trying to be jack of many trades, it helped me focus. I started solving any new coding challenge in Java (before, I was doing them in Python). This helped me get even more familiar with Java - particularly at writing solutions for typical coding challenges. After a point, you will start thinking in terms of pseudo-code and core algorithm, rather than having a corner of your brain always wondering how you would go about implementing it in Java. We need help from all the neurons we can get if we aim to impress!

While it's not strictly necessary, it might also help if you have a set of companies you are aiming for. I had the big 4 - Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft, on my list. Share your list with a few friends and ask them for an honest feedback because that will help you figure out if, you are being too ambitious, or selling yourself short. The big tech companies usually stress on Computer Science fundamentals so, it really doesn't matter which names are on your list. However, if you are going after very specialised firms, this could help you identify where you should devote your time - a particular tool or tech stack or design concept, you get the point.


Preparation
----
This goes without saying but I’m going to say it anyway: Practice makes you perfect. There are plethora of sources on and off the web that will help you reach perfection but as I clarified at the very onset, this post is about what worked for *me* and so, it continues be, opinionated. I solved every question from CTCI the way they are meant to be - writing code on a white paper and typing it back on a computer for verification. This helped me pickup some otherwise trivial details about writing code with no assistance from auto-complete and such. Also, this way you won’t discover your particular lack of skill to do so during the actual interview - we have enough surprises waiting for us as is, so don’t leave things to chance. As far as online prep goes, I solved questions from Google codejam, Codeforces, hackerrank, and leetcode. Each of them have subtile differences in the solution submission format and I think that’s a big factor in picking the right one for you. For reasons I will now discuss, I preferred Leetcode. Google codejam was an easy elimination because the problems level is much higher than what you would come across in a typical interview and I didn’t want to kill my confidence. While hackerrank, codeforces and leetcode all offered problems of various levels, leetcode’s solution submission format kept track of invalid submissions and that’s a huge deal! Since Leetcode keeps track of invalid solutions - timeouts, failing corner cases, and runtime errors, I was forced to run my solutions in mind before submission - exactly what you will be doing during the interview! And when the submission did fail, you get to see the failing test case - this way I can deduce quickly where I went wrong. Most other sites doesn’t reveal the failing test case and thus making you spend more time to figure it out yourself without any clue what could have gone wrong. The latter, hidden test cases, of course has it’s own advantages and I myself emulated this with Leetcode by choosing not to look at the failing input until I’m exhausted enough. Long story short, I found Leetcode as the best fit from a coding interview preparation point of view.
